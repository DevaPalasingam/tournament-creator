# Tournament Creator

A tool that you can use to run rated tournaments using the ELO rating system.

## Description

Some day this project will be really cool. The main purpose for this project is so that I can continue to develop my coding skills in a way that I find interesting. I also have a group of friends who enjoy random competitions like ping pong and chess. So I thought this might be an interesting idea.

## Technologies Used

### Alpine.js

After doing a lot of googling, I've decided that I wanted to start this project with AlpineJS. My anticipation is that this project is not going to be very heavy, so I figured that I don't really need a full-on framework like React or Angular for very simple functionality. Also, AlpineJS seems perfect for someone who wants to be able to quickly pump out projects on a whim.

## Future development

- Change in ELO rating based on win/loss
- Adding a database so that you can store players/teams
- Adding option to let you create your own tournament
