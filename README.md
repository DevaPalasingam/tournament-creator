# Tournament Creator

A tool that you can use to run rated tournaments using the ELO rating system.

## Description

Some day this project will be really cool. The main purpose for this project is so that I can continue to develop my coding skills in a way that I find interesting. I also have a group of friends who enjoy random competitions like ping pong and chess. So I thought this might be an interesting idea.

## Future development

### Features and functionalities that I want to add

- Change in ELO rating based on win/loss
- Adding a database so that you can store players/teams
- Adding option to let you create your own tournament
